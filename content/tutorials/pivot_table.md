## What is a Pivot Table?

A pivot table is a toll in Excel that makes it easy to quickly summarize a dataset. More powerful tools are required to work with huge sets of data, but pivot tables work great to quickly gather insights about smaller sets.

### Getting Started

#### Step 1. The Dataset

In the example today, I am working with the [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Kaggle is a reat place to get data to practice on. The video game sales dataset shows sales data for over 16,000 games. This is a great size to use pivot tables on, depending on your processor, I suppose.  

#### Dataset must haves:
- Must be organized in columns (headers across the top), rather than in rows (headers down the side).
- All columns must have names (these must be unique)
